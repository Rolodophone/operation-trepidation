Perform operations by swiftly carrying out the correct actions in the correct order. Beware, if one of the pain, infection, or blood loss gauges reaches 100%, the patient dies, and it’s back to square one. There are 3 levels of increasing difficulty; good luck!

Look at the hints; they will help you!

This is my second time participating and my first working game. I appreciate any feedback, positive or negative. Thank you for trying my game and I hope you enjoyed it. smiley
